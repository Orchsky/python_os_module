1. Why Python 
    1.1 Relatively easy 
    1.2 It's very useful in ML, AI, Data Science 
    1.3. Rich library to work with different fields of IT 
    1.4 SDK (Software Development Kit) such as boto3 



    As an end user we run variios apps/browser on laptop/virtual machine. In order to run apps we need OS (Operating System, Platform, 
    Linux Flavors, Distros (Distributions))
     
    OS flavors:
    1. Windows 
    2. MacOS (Darwin)
    3. RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
    4. Centos 
    5. Ubuntu 
    6. Kali 
    7. Android 
    8. Debian
    9. Amazon Linux 


Benefit of Python in AWS (Cloud)

1. Let's say somebody deletes VPC Flow log, what would be your solution? To use Python because Python 
has great SDK (Software Development Kit) which is BOTO3. Event Driven Architecture. 


2. Why do we need to deal with directories and files inside directories as a DevOps engineer? 
We closely work with Developer (Develoopers). They develop applications in Java/Javasacript/NodeJs/C#/Dotenet and etc. 
They create binary files in gzip/zip format and push to Artifactory such as Jfrog/Nexus. 
What is binary/Artifactory/Archive? Basically it's executable file compressed/packed together.
As a DevSecOps engineers (Cloud Engineers/SRE (Site Relibility Engineering)) we need to get binaries and 
deploy to remote servers (EC2/VM). 
Steps of deployment:
    1. Create application directory in VM. Such as: /opt/banking
    2. Define which file what kind of permissions has 
    3. Create directory for application logs. Example of Error logs: Permission error, Out of Memory,
    Application works on port 9091 but this port is blocked in Security Group level. 

3. Maximum file size can be pushed to GitHub? 100 MB. If you files larger than 100 MB needs to be pushed 
to GitHub? Solution: git-lfs (Large File System)
